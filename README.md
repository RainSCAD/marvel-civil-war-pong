# marvel-civil-war-pong
a custom-coded browser game I created using JavaScript and p5.js. Inspired by classic Pong and Marvel’s Civil War, players can choose from different heroes—each with their own abilities—and compete on themed battlegrounds. The game features original screens, background transitions, hero icons, and interactive gameplay.
